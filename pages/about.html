            The 2014 Apple Harvest Festival holds plenty of apples, local produce, fresh
            baked goods, family entertainment at every turn, games, rides, prizes and live
            performances on two stages. Apple Harvest Festival is a great introduction to
            the rich farm and artist community of Ithaca.  First time visitors can witness
            a variety of wonderful local entertainment while also visiting the historical
            outdoor pedestrian shopping mall, The Ithaca Commons.  The pedestrian mall is
            the epicenter of the festival and the gateway to a nostalgic journey to harvest
            season fun.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            The event started as a small harvest festival in 1982 to showcase the area&rsquo;s diverse
            agricultural products. With heavy involvement from Cornell and a partnership with
            downtown merchants including David Abdulky and Lyle McCartney, the event was strictly
            a farmers market. Over time, the addition of food and craft vendors, games, and other
            activities for children grew the event into what it is today. The event attracts an
            audience of over 30,000 patrons over the three days.
